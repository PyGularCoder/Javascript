## `let`

The `let` keyword introduces block scope to variable declarations in JavaScript. Unlike `var`, which declares variables with function scope, `let` restricts the variable's accessibility to the block in which it's declared. This helps prevent hoisting-related issues and makes code more predictable.

In the provided example, the `let` declaration of `name` within the `if` block confines its accessibility to that particular block. Therefore, the variable `name` is not accessible outside the `if` block, including in the `greet` function. Consequently, when `greet` is called, it attempts to access the value of `name`, but it finds `name` to be undefined, leading to the output "Hello, undefined!" in the console.


```javascript
function greet(name) {
  if (name === "John Doe") {
    console.log("Hello, John Doe!");
  } else {
    console.log("Hello,", name);
  }
}

let name = "John Doe"; // Block-scoped declaration
greet(name);
```

1. The `greet` function is defined with a parameter `name`.

2. Inside the function, the `if` statement checks if `name` is equal to "John Doe".

3. If `name` is equal to "John Doe", the `console.log` statement prints "Hello, John Doe!" to the console.

4. Otherwise, the `console.log` statement prints "Hello," followed by the value of `name`, to the console.

5. The variable `name` is declared using the `let` keyword inside the `if` block, restricting its scope to that block.

6. Finally, the `greet` function is called with the value of `name` as an argument.

Since `name` is declared with `let` within the `if` block, it's not accessible outside that block. Therefore, when `greet` attempts to access `name`, it finds it undefined, resulting in the output "Hello, undefined!" in the console.
